# Football Ticket Booking System - Database Design & SQL Queries

## Overview & Objectives

This assignment is designed to evaluate your understanding of database table design, ERD relationships, and intermediate-to-advanced SQL queries. You will work with a simplified **Football Ticket Booking System** database.

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

- Design an ERD with 1-to-1, 1-to-Many, and Many-to-1 relationships.
- Understand primary keys, foreign keys, and referential integrity.
- Write complex SQL queries using `JOIN` variants, subqueries, aggregations, pattern matching, null handling, and pagination.

## Database Design & Business Logic

The system manages football fans purchasing tickets, upcoming tournament matches, and individual ticket booking receipts.

### Business Logic & Schema Architecture

Your database design must handle these real-world scenarios by implementing the following exact table fields:

### 1. Users Table

This table tracks all administrative staff and customers who use the platform.

| **Field Name** | **What the Field Does** |
| --- | --- |
| `user_id` | Unique identification number for each registered user. |
| `full_name` | Stores the first and last name of the user. |
| `email` | Stores the user's mail address used for login. |
| `role` | Defines access permissions (`Ticket Manager` or `Football Fan`). |
| `phone_number` | Stores the contact mobile number of the fan. |

### 2. Matches Table

This table catalogs the tournament events, stadium logistics, and baseline ticket inventory pricing.

| **Field Name** | **What the Field Does** |
| --- | --- |
| `match_id` | Unique identification number for each football match. |
| `fixture` | Tracks the two competing teams (e.g., *Real Madrid vs Barcelona*). |
| `tournament_category` | The league or cup title (e.g., *Champions League*, *Premier League*). |
| `base_ticket_price` | The foundational price for a single standard entry seat. |
| `match_status` | Current ticket availability state (`Available`, `Selling Fast`, `Sold Out`, `Postponed`). |

### 3. Bookings Table

This transactional table records individual ticket purchases by linking users to their chosen matches.

| **Field Name** | **What the Field Does** |
| --- | --- |
| `booking_id` | Unique tracking transaction number for the ticket purchase. |
| `user_id` | Links the booking directly to the user who made the purchase. |
| `match_id` | Links the booking directly to the specific match being attended. |
| `seat_number` | The specific allocated seat identifier in the stadium (e.g., `A-12`). |
| `payment_status` | Tracks financial resolution (`Pending`, `Confirmed`, `Cancelled`, `Refunded`). |
| `total_cost` | The calculated final invoice price based on the base price and seat quantity. |

## Part 1: ERD Design (Mandatory)

*Note: You must submit your ERD in the submission; otherwise, you will get 0 marks.*

Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Football Ticket Booking System.

### Required Tables

You must include the following tables:

1. Users
2. Matches
3. Bookings

### Relationship Requirements

Your ERD must clearly show:

- **One to Many:** One User → Many Bookings (A single football fan can buy tickets for multiple matches throughout the season).
- **Many to One:** Many Bookings → One Match (A major derby match can be associated with thousands of individual booking records from different fans).
- **One to One (logical):** Each individual row in the booking table maps exactly one user to one match for that specific reserved seating choice.

### ERD Must Include

- Primary Keys (PK)
- Foreign Keys (FK)
- Relationship cardinality (e.g., Crow’s Foot notation)
- Status fields (e.g., booking payment status, match ticket status)

### Submission Format

You need to submit your ERD as:

- **[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com)** or **[Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net)** ERD Tool
- Submit a public, shareable ERD link (ensure permissions are set to "Anyone with the link can view").

## Schema & Sample Data

| 3 | Sajjad Rahman | sajjad@mail.com | Ticket Manager | +8801733333333 |
| 4 | Jannat Ara | jannat@mail.com | Football Fan | *NULL* |

### 2. Matches Table

| **match_id** | **fixture** | **tournament_category** | **base_ticket_price** | **match_status** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 101 | Real Madrid vs Barcelona | Champions League | 150 | Available |

### 3. Bookings Table

| **booking_id** | **user_id** | **match_id** | **seat_number** | **payment_status** | **total_cost** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 501 | 1 | 101 | A-12 | Confirmed | 150 |
| 502 | 1 | 102 | B-04 | Confirmed | 120 |

| 504 | 2 | 101 | *NULL* | *NULL* | 150 |
| 505 | 3 | 102 | C-20 | Pending | 120 |

## Part 2: SQL Queries & Expected Sample Output (Open the [QUERY.sql](./QUERY.sql) file and start your queries from there)

### Query 1: Retrieve all upcoming football matches belonging to the 'Champions League' where the match status is 'Available'.

**Sample Output:**

| **match_id** | **fixture** | **base_ticket_price** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 101 | Real Madrid vs Barcelona | 150 |
| 103 | Bayern Munich vs PSG | 130 |

### Query 2: Search for all users whose full names start with 'Tanvir' or contain the phrase 'Haque' (case-insensitive).

- **Concepts used:** `LIKE`, `ILIKE`

**Sample Output:**

| **user_id** | **full_name** | **email** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tanvir Rahman | tanvir@mail.com |
| 2 | Asif Haque | asif@mail.com |

### Query 3: Retrieve all booking records where the payment status is missing (`NULL`), replacing the empty result with 'Action Required'.

- **Concepts used:** `IS NULL`, `COALESCE`

**Sample Output:**

| **booking_id** | **user_id** | **match_id** | **systematic_status** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 504 | 2 | 101 | Action Required |

### Query 4: Retrieve match booking details along with the User's full name and the scheduled Match fixture teams.

- **Concepts used:** `INNER JOIN`

**Sample Output:**

| **booking_id** | **full_name** | **fixture** | **total_cost** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 501 | Tanvir Rahman | Real Madrid vs Barcelona | 150 |
| 502 | Tanvir Rahman | Man City vs Liverpool | 120 |
| 503 | Asif Haque | Real Madrid vs Barcelona | 150 |
| 504 | Asif Haque | Real Madrid vs Barcelona | 150 |
| 505 | Sajjad Rahman | Man City vs Liverpool | 120 |

### Query 5: Display a comprehensive list of all users and their booking IDs, ensuring that fans who have *never* bought a ticket are still listed.

- **Concepts used:** `LEFT JOIN / Full JOIN`

**Sample Output:**

| **user_id** | **full_name** | **booking_id** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tanvir Rahman | 501 |
| 1 | Tanvir Rahman | 502 |
| 2 | Asif Haque | 503 |
| 2 | Asif Haque | 504 |
| 3 | Sajjad Rahman | 505 |
| 4 | Jannat Ara | *NULL* |

### Query 6: Find all ticket bookings where the total cost is strictly higher than the average cost of all ticket bookings.

**Sample Output:**

| **booking_id** | **match_id** | **total_cost** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 501 | 101 | 150 |
| 503 | 101 | 150 |
| 504 | 101 | 150 |

### Query 7: Retrieve the top 2 most expensive matches sorted by base ticket price, skipping the absolute highest premium match.

**Sample Output:**

*(Skips Real Madrid vs Barcelona at 150)*

| **match_id** | **fixture** | **base_ticket_price** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 103 | Bayern Munich vs PSG | 130 |
| 102 | Man City vs Liverpool | 120 |

## Part 3: Theory Questions (Viva Practice - `Answer any 3`)

**Question 1:** What role does a Foreign Key play in the Bookings table, and how does it safeguard against entering a ticket sale for a match that doesn't exist?

**Question 2:** Why are we unable to use an aggregate function like `COUNT(booking_id)` inside a standard `WHERE` clause to filter match rows? How does `HAVING` solve this?

**Question 3:** If a Primary Key column guarantees that all row entries are completely unique, why does the database system also explicitly forbid it from containing a `NULL` value?

**Question 4:** Imagine a newly registered fan who hasn't bought any match tickets yet. If you run a `LEFT JOIN` linking the Users table (left) to the Bookings table (right), what will the resulting rows look like for that specific fan?

**Question 5:** What is the difference between a main query and a subquery? In what scenarios would you choose to use a subquery over a standard `JOIN` operation?
